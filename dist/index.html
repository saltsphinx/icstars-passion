      <p>Hello and welcome to my website, Machine Playlist. My name is Tremar, and  as of June 2024, I am an intern at i.c.stars, apart of Cycle 55. I've had many passing interests in my life, but the few to stick around have been: My love for music, need to learn and explore, and my more recent passion for programming. This website in particular is dedicated to the music I love, my favorite artists, and a bit about my interest in how we all experience and enjoy music.</p>
